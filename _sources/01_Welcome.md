# Welcome!
The (TU Delft) DCC guides aims to provide a low threshold and comprehensive entrypoint to get yu started with Research Computing, Research Data and Research Software at TU Delft. 

**The guides are split into three main topics:**
Computing, data and software

**We also provide guidance on how to:**
- [Get support from the DCC](./04_About/04_About_DCC.html#how-we-work-and-support-our-community)
- [Participate and contribute to address issues you and other colleagues might have with regard to Computing, Data and Software](https://github.com/TU-Delft-DCC/TU-Delft-DCC.github.io/discussions/1)

**Our mission is to provide hands on knowledge transfer, support and contributions that enable research with better data and software practices**.
In order for us to help you and others we work towards more:
- Openness
- FAIR data
- Open source research software
- Collaboration and community driven progress
